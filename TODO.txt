- Unit test: HttpTask + run all tests
- UI for HttpTask

- For all tasks: notifications (downtime exceeded the setpoint, JSON data setpoint)

// testing with dagger
// add Robolectric, espresso tests

// Ping task: calculate and display uptime and downtime
// Manager - reads next execution time from all the tasks and sleeps until the next execution is needed
// Manager - if the task is being executed, but user deletes it? + add test case
// Manager - implement with a thread pool, so several tasks could be executed simultaneously

// instead of service - try WorkManager https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrKoBFLwTN0

// Add RxJava + RxBindings library from Jake Wharton
// Rewrite in Kotlin. Also try to use composition instead of inheritance
