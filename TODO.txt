- UI for HttpTask:
BUG: the edit fragment is "see through" - you can click to create a new task
BUG: when HttpTask times out - the error message says "timeout" but the error code = 0
HttpTask - set timeout time
BUG: HttpTask headers in the recyclerview sometimes become colored gray - why is that?
TEST button

The rest of the UI for HttpTask (incl. trends)
By default, when a new task is created, fill the fields with some public REST API request

- BUG: portrait mode - no scrolling in the edit fragments
- "Run every" TIME selection - choose units to enter the time (seconds, minutes, hours)
