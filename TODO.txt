// Fix the toolbar - use support library for dagger!
// Remove getInstance - DI handles this now

// Add RecyclerView (dagger - inject adapter: http://frogermcs.github.io/inject-everything-viewholder-and-dagger-2-example/)

// Add shared prefs

// add Robolectric UI test
// add espresso test

// Add MQQT task (A repository for MQQT profiles)

// Ping task: calculate and display uptime and downtime
// Manager - reads next execution time from all the tasks and sleeps until the next execution is needed
// Manager - if the task is being executed, but user deletes it? + add test case
// Manager - implement with a thread pool, so several tasks could be executed simultaneously

// instead of service - try WorkManager https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrKoBFLwTN0


// MVVM instead of MVP?
// Add RxJava + RxBindings library from Jake Wharton
